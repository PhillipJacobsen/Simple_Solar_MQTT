# Simple_Solar_MQTT
 Demo application using authenticated MQTT access to receive Solar.org blockchain events

This project is designed to run on any ESP32 microcontroller
    Blockchain event packets are sent to the serial port as ASCII text for display on terminal program running on PC
    LED is toggled at every blockchain event    

    Required Libraries:
      EspMQTTClient by Patrick Lapointe Version 1.13.3
      ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon Version 6.19.4
      PubSubClient by Nick O'Leary Version 2.8
        The MQTT JSON packets are larger then the default setting in the libary.
        You need to increase max packet size from 128 to 4096 via this line in \Arduino\libraries\PubSubClient\src\PubSubClient.h
            #define MQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE 4096  //default 128
      
    MQTT Server Access
      I operate a special MQTT broker that receives realtime Solar.org blockchain events from both Testnet and Mainnet networks.
      Special thanks to @deadlock for creating a plugin to enable this. https://github.com/deadlock-delegate/mqtt
      MQTT connections are able to subscribe to these blockchain events.
      MQTT server access is provided by a unique authentication method.  
        Authentication credentials are generated by signing a message using your blockchain private keys and by voting for my delegate with your wallet.
        Currently the authentication method uses the Solar Testnet. Future support for Solar Mainnet will be added
